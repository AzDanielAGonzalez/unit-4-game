# unit-4-game
I could not get my game to function correctly in the end. I used many different types of ways to make the buttons work, but in the end I could not find the solution to make them 'click' properly. I finally feel a bit comfortable to add css into my page, although it doesn't look perfect, I believe I got the right start. I would like to go back and make my game work, maybe add more CSS properties, because I know I was very close to a nice application.
